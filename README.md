# DBF Viewer (Angular + Patched DBF Reader)

A clean and lightweight DBF viewer built with Angular and TailwindCSS.  
It features automatic encoding detection, CSV export, and a patched DBF parser capable of handling nearly all DBF formats used across legacy systems.

## 🔍 Features
- Automatic DBF character encoding detection
- Manual encoding override (cp866, win-1251, utf‑8, Latin1, KOI8‑R, etc.)
- CSV export with Excel‑safe BOM
- Modern UI with light/dark theme toggle
- Works entirely client‑side (no backend needed)

## 🧩 Patched DBF Reader
This project uses a patched version of the original **dbf-reader** library  
➡ Original repo: https://github.com/abstractvector/dbf-reader

### What was patched?
- Correct handling of multi‑byte character fields
- Full binary‐safe buffering  
- Stable mapping of columns → row values  
- Extended compatibility for DBF variants

### Supported DBF formats
The patched reader successfully works with:
- dBase III / dBase IV
- FoxPro / Visual FoxPro
- Clipper DBF
- xBase DBF
- DBF files from banking systems
- DBF files generated by COBOL‑style systems
- DBF files with OEM encodings (cp866, ibm855)
- DBF files with Windows encodings (win‑1251, win‑1250)
- Long‑field and memo-compatible DBF layouts  
*(memo (.dbt) files are not parsed but DBF remains readable)*

This makes the parser suitable for environments that rely on long‑existing DBF workflows, including financial, archival, governmental, and legacy business systems.
